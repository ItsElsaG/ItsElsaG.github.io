    <h1>Why I want to work at Dr.Idriss</h1>
    
    <p>My name is Elsa Granados and I currently work as a freelance social media copywriter for beauty brands. <br>
    I graduated from the University of South Florida with a degree in English about 3 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>I am a copywriter, Linkedin creator, and aspiring front-end developer.<br> In my free time,
        I regularly create content about marketing and coding (HTML). 
    </p>

    <h2>Marketing Educator on LinkedIn</h2>
    <p>I started posting content on LinkedIn 3 months ago to share my passion about marketing and coding.<br>
    My experience as a creator on the platform has brought me a unique perspective and insights to what makes content creation on Linkedin engaging.</p>
    <p>So what does creating content on LinkedIn look like? I scroll through LinkedIn for a couple of minutes sometimes for hours 
        to understand what type of content is performing well, to understand my audience, or sometimes I am just looking for inspiration for my own content.

    <h2>Freelance Social Media Copywriter for Beauty Brands</h2>
    <p>I write and design social media posts and content for beauty brands.</p>

    <h2>Passionate and knowledgeable in Skincare</h2>
    <p>I started watching Dr.Idriss videos, because I wanted to improve my skincare and skincare had always interest. 
        I went through a very bad acne phase and I am glad that I was able to clear my acne by watching Dr. Idriss skincare videos.
        As a huge fan and viewer of Dr.Idriss, I can understand your audience pain points and relate with them, I am knowledgeable
        about your brand, and I have learned so much skincare information from watching Dr. Idriss skincare videos.
